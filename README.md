A* Pathfinding visualizer - 1/5/2021

-> Click on two points to define start and end points

-> Click and drag to draw out obstacles

-> Space to watch the algorithm find the shortest path!

-> Hit "v" before running the program to watch the algorithm in action!

-> Hit "c" to clear the grid

(Might add more features like timer and find shortest path between multiple sets of points...)
